# Traffic-Optimization-at-Intersection
Our project aims to create a traffic signal control system using the YOLOv8 model for accurate vehicle detection. By employing efficient algorithms, we prioritize congested lanes and emergency vehicles. Tested in real-world intersections, this system enhances traffic flow and ensures emergency vehicles can pass quickly, making city streets smarter.
